Here’s a README.md file for your repository:

Server Slack Updates

Overview

This repository contains a server monitoring script that sends updates to a designated Slack channel at regular intervals. The script is designed to provide system administrators with real-time status updates, including logged-in users, system activity, and detected SSH login attempts.

Features
	•	Sends hourly system status updates to Slack.
	•	Notifies when users log in or fail authentication attempts.
	•	Logs and reports Fail2Ban bans to Slack.
	•	Uses cron jobs to automate notifications.
	•	Includes a basic Fail2Ban configuration for SSH protection.

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Fluffymuffin11/ServerslackUpdates.git
cd ServerslackUpdates


	2.	Make the script executable:

chmod +x server_status.sh


	3.	Set up a Slack Incoming Webhook and update the script with your webhook URL.
	4.	Add a cron job to run the script automatically:

crontab -e

Add the following line to execute the script every hour:

0 * * * * /path/to/server_status.sh



Planned Features
	•	Nmap Scan Detection: Whenever it decides to cooperate, I plan to add a Fail2Ban jail for Nmap scans, which will trigger Slack notifications whenever an unauthorized Nmap scan is detected on the server.
